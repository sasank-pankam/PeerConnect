# Deprecated: Server Connection and User List Management Module

**Note:**  
Module is deprecated and may be removed in future releases. It handles initial connection setup with the server and the retrieval of a list of remote users. Newer implementations should be used for server connectivity and user discovery.

---

## Overview

Implements the following functionalities:

- **Establishing Connection:**  
  Connects to a designated server using TCP and verifies connection status using predefined headers.

- **User List Retrieval:**  
  Once connected, the module retrieves an initial list of remote users. It supports both direct and redirected connections:
  - **Direct Connection:**  
    The server responds with a confirmation header and sends the user list.
  - **Redirected Connection:**  
    If the server issues a redirect (via a specific header), the module connects to an alternative peer to obtain the user list.

- **Error Handling:**  
  The module includes rudimentary error handling (e.g., timeouts, retry logic, and handling of socket errors) and a mechanism to send a quit status to the server when disconnecting.

## Key Functions

### `get_initial_list(no_of_users, initiate_socket)`

- **Purpose:**  
  Receives a specified number of user entries from the server over the given socket.
- **Behavior:**  
  For each user, it:
  - Waits for data asynchronously using `Wire.receive_async`.
  - Loads a `RemotePeer` object from the received raw data.
  - Queues the peer and logs the received user.
- **Return:**  
  Returns `True` after successfully receiving the entire list.

---

### `get_list_from(initiate_socket)`

- **Purpose:**  
  Reads the total number of users (as a 64-bit unsigned integer) from the socket, then calls `get_initial_list` to retrieve the list.
- **Usage:**  
  Encapsulates the logic for retrieving the user list from an already established connection.

---

### `list_error_handler()`

- **Purpose:**  
  Handles errors encountered during the list retrieval process.
- **Behavior:**  
  - Retrieves a peer from the global peer list.
  - Connects to the peer and sends a request for the list.
  - Attempts to retrieve the list again after encountering an error.
- **Note:**  
  Demonstrates a basic error recovery strategy for list retrieval.

---

### `list_from_forward_control(list_owner: RemotePeer)`

- **Purpose:**  
  Initiates a connection to a specified peer (provided by the server in a redirect) to retrieve the user list.
- **Behavior:**  
  - Connects to the given peer.
  - Sends a list request header.
  - Calls `get_list_from` to retrieve the user list.

---

### `initiate_connection()`

- **Purpose:**  
  Handles the initial connection process with the server.
- **Behavior:**  
  - Establishes a connection via `setup_server_connection()`.
  - Waits for a response header (e.g., `SERVER_OK` or `REDIRECT`).
  - Depending on the header:
    - Retrieves the user list directly.
    - Or follows the redirection logic to retrieve the list from another peer.
- **Return:**  
  Returns `True` on successful connection and list retrieval, otherwise `False`.

---

### `setup_server_connection()`

- **Purpose:**  
  Establishes a connection to the server by iterating over possible timeouts.
- **Behavior:**  
  - Tries to create a connection using `connect.create_connection_async`.
  - If successful, sends the local peer’s data.
  - Returns the connection socket if established, otherwise returns `None`.

---

### `send_quit_status_to_server()`

- **Purpose:**  
  Sends a quit or disconnect status to the server when the client is shutting down.
- **Behavior:**  
  - Sets the local peer’s status to indicate disconnection.
  - Establishes a connection to the server and sends the local peer’s data.
  - Returns `True` if the operation succeeds, or `False` if it fails.

---

## Summary

Was (deprecated) responsible for managing the initial connection to the server and retrieving a list of remote peers. It provided mechanisms for:

- Establishing both direct and redirected server connections.
- Handling user list retrieval and error recovery.
- Sending a disconnect status to the server upon shutdown.

While the module demonstrates basic connection and error handling logic, newer designs and patterns (such as improved dependency injection and asynchronous connection management) are recommended for future development.
