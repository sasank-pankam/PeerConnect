# Deprecated Process Manager Module (managers/processmanager.py)

⚠️ **Deprecation Notice**: This module is no longer in use and maintained for legacy reference only

## Overview

Originally designed for distributed task processing using multiprocessing, featuring:

- Process pool management
- Load-balanced task distribution
- Cross-process communication
- Thread/process hybrid execution model

## Key Components

### 1. Process Control

    ```python
    class ProcessControl:
        """Manages individual worker processes with:
        - Load monitoring
        - Task execution
        - Result handling
        """
    ```

### 2. Process Store

    ```python
    class ProcessStore:
        """Central registry for:
        - Process instances
        - Task queues
        - Result handling
        - Load balancing
        """
    ```

### 3. Task Handling

    ```python
    class HandleRepr:
        """Serializable task representation for cross-process communication"""
    ```

## Architecture

| Component          | Responsibility                             | Technology Used          |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| ProcessControl     | Per-process task execution                 | multiprocessing          |
| ProcessStore       | System-wide resource management            | ThreadPoolExecutor       |
| HandleRepr         | Task serialization                         | Pickle (implicit)        |
| result_watcher     | Result monitoring                          | Dedicated thread         |

## Important Notes

1. **Deprecation Reasons**
   - Complex process synchronization requirements
   - High memory overhead
   - Replaced by async/thread-based task system

2. **Key Legacy Concepts**
   - MAX_LOAD configuration for process count
   - Color-coded process debugging
   - Hybrid thread/process execution
