# Message Manager Module Documentation

Responsible for managing message processing and dispatching in PeerConnect. It handles incoming message connections, dispatches messages to appropriate handlers, and provides utilities for sending messages to peers. The module leverages asynchronous programming, connection pooling, and concurrency control to process messages efficiently.

---

## Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  Manages the flow of messages (e.g., text messages, pings) between peers. It establishes and maintains a pool of message connections, dispatches incoming messages to registered handlers, and facilitates sending messages with optional reply handling.

- **Key Responsibilities:**  
  - Initiate and register message dispatching services.
  - Process incoming messages over established TCP connections.
  - Provide a mechanism for sending messages to a specified peer.
  - Handle ping messages to maintain connectivity.

## Main Components

### 1. Initiation and Dispatcher Setup

#### `initiate(exit_stack, dispatchers, finalizing)`

- **Description:**  
  Sets up the message dispatching system.
- **Functionality:**  
  - Creates a `MsgDispatcher` instance and registers a text message handler (from `pagehandle.MessageHandler`).
  - Adds the dispatcher to the global dispatchers map using the `DISPATCHS.MESSAGES` key.
  - Creates a message connection handler (`MessageConnHandler`) and registers it for the message connection header (`HEADERS.CMD_MSG_CONN`), as well as a ping handler for the `HEADERS.PING` header.
  - Enters both the dispatcher and a global locks stack into the asynchronous exit stack for resource management.

### 2. Message Dispatching

#### `MsgDispatcher` Class

- **Base Classes:**  
  Inherits from `QueueMixIn`, `ReplyRegistryMixIn`, and `BaseDispatcher`.
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Receives and queues message events.
  - Looks up and calls the appropriate handler based on the message header.
  - Supports waiting for replies when necessary.

#### `MessageConnHandler(data_dispatcher, finalizer)`

- **Purpose:**  
  Processes an incoming TCP stream of messages.
- **Key Details:**  
  - Uses a semaphore limiter (`MAX_CONCURRENT_MSG_PROCESSING`) to restrict concurrent message processing.
  - For each incoming message, it creates a `MessageEvent` and submits it to the `data_dispatcher` for handling.
  - Continuously processes messages as long as the provided finalizer function returns `True`.

### 3. Ping Handling

#### `PingHandler()`

- **Function:**  
  Returns an asynchronous handler that responds to incoming ping messages.
- **Behavior:**  
  - Upon receiving a ping (a `WireData` message), it constructs an "unping" message and sends it back to the originating peer.
  - Ensures connectivity confirmation using the peer's message connection.

### 4. Message Connection Management

#### Global Variables

- **`_locks_stack`:**  
  An `AsyncExitStack` used to manage the lifecycle of message connection locks.
- **`_msg_conn_pool`:**  
  A dictionary that maintains a pool of message connections keyed by the remote peer.

#### `get_msg_conn(peer: RemotePeer)`

- **Description:**  
  An asynchronous context manager that provides a message connection for the specified peer.
- **Behavior:**  
  - If a connection already exists in the pool for the given peer, it is refreshed (using the bandwidth watcher) and returned.
  - If not, a new connection is established using the `Connector`, a handshake is performed, and the connection is stored in the pool.
  - The connection is wrapped in a `MsgConnectionNoRecv` to restrict direct receiving if required.

### 5. Sending Messages

#### `send_message(msg, peer, *, expect_reply=False)`

- **Purpose:**  
  Sends a `WireData` message to the specified peer.
- **Workflow:**  
  - Retrieves or creates a message connection for the peer using `get_msg_conn`.
  - Sends the message over the connection.
  - Optionally waits for a reply if `expect_reply` is set to `True`.

## Summary

The Message Manager Module integrates the following functionalities:

- **Message Dispatching:**  
  Incoming messages are queued and dispatched based on their headers to the appropriate handlers.
- **Connection Management:**  
  A pool of message connections is maintained to efficiently reuse established connections, ensuring that new messages are sent over existing channels when possible.
- **Ping Support:**  
  Ping messages are handled to verify connectivity between peers.
- **Message Sending:**  
  Provides a high-level API (`send_message`) to send messages asynchronously, with optional reply handling.

Overall, this module forms the core of PeerConnect's messaging system, ensuring reliable, asynchronous communication between peers.
