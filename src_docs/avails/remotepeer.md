# RemotePeer

This module defines the `RemotePeer` class, which represents a network peer in the PeerConnect system. It includes attributes and methods that support the peer’s identification and communication.

## RemotePeer Class

- **Attributes:**
  - `username`: The display name of the peer.
  - `ip`: The IP address of the peer.
  - `_conn_port` and `_req_port`: Ports used for connection and request handling.
  - `status`: Indicates whether the peer is online or offline.
  - `id`: A unique byte identifier for the peer.
  - `long_id`: An integer representation of the peer’s ID for comparison purposes.
  - `_byte_cache`: Used internally to cache serialized representations.

- **Key Methods and Properties:**
  - `same_home_as(node)`: Checks if two peers share the same IP and port details.
  - `distance_to(node)`: Computes a bitwise distance between this peer and another.
  - `__iter__()`: Allows the object to be unpacked into a tuple of attributes.
  - `uri` and `req_uri`: Properties that format the connection and request addresses respectively.
  - `load_from(data)`: Class method to create an instance from serialized data.
  - `is_relevant(match_string)`: Determines if a given search string is relevant to the peer’s username.
  - `__bytes__()`: Returns a byte representation of the peer.
  - `peer_id`: Provides a string version of the peer’s long ID.

## Helper Function

- **convert_peer_id_to_byte_id(peer_id):**  
  Converts a string peer ID into its corresponding byte representation.

## Purpose

- Represents peer nodes in the network with Kademlia compatibility.

- This module is central to peer management, providing all the necessary methods to represent, compare, and serialize peers in a networked environment.
